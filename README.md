# warspotting-scraper

https://ukr.warspotting.net/ appears to have no API that would allow getting the historical losses with weapon models and dates

this data is useful for creating charts such as stacked bar chart to compare monthly losses by weapon model (and many other charts or simply stats)

hence, this script for scraping data and saving it as a csv file

prerequisites: have node.js installed

install: npm i

run: npm run start

change url in index.js to get historical data for a different weapon type

see example of the format in output-example.csv
